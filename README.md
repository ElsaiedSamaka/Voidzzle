# NextTS Integration with Redux Toolkit

This is a template for creating a NextJS application that uses `redux-toolkit` to manage side effects.

We use `redux-devtools-extension` when running in developer mode to log actions and state changes and we
use `redux-persist` to save state between browser refreshes.
